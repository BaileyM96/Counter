# Counter

## Description
Made a counter to practice my vanilla JavaScript by using document queryselector all and regular queryselector and used the navigation of the DOM tree to use JavaScript on the elements. I used a forEach loop to loop through each button and make it either decrease, increase, or reset using addEventListener function.The application is still a work in progress I still need to style the webpage to give it a better look.

## Usage

The application can be accessed through your web browser no downloads needed
